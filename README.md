# VREP-Self Driving Car Simulation with python API
This repository contains all the files needed to get started with a self driving car simulation in VREP.

### Instructions for windows users
1. Clone/ fork the repository.
2. Open the scene file (sdc.ttt), it contains all the appropriate models, sensors and scripts configured to connect to the python API.
3. Run the VREP simulation before you run the car_model.py python script.

### Dependencies
Python 3.5.2 or above

OpenCV 2 with python bindings

Pillow

Numpy

Tqdm (to make it look fancy)

### Credits
If you find this work useful in any way, be sure to star it and maybe shoot me a message at karanb@terpmail.umd.edu on any possible improvements. I sincerely thank Qi Wang for the VREP model of the Manta (on which the whole system is built).
