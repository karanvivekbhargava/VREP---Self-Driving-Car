# VREP - Self Driving Car Simulation with Python API

This repository contains all the files needed to get started with a self driving car simulation in VREP.

### Instructions for windows users
1. Clone/ fork the repository.
2. Open the scene file (`sdc.ttt`), it contains all the appropriate models, sensors and scripts configured to connect to the python API.
3. Run the VREP simulation before you run the car_model.py python script.

### Dependencies
1. Python 3.5.2 or above (best install the latest anaconda version found at https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
2. OpenCV 2 (just do `pip install opencv-contrib-python` in the terminal or command prompt and you should be good.)
3. Numpy (similarly `pip install numpy`)
4. imutils (just do `pip install imutils` in the terminal or command prompt)

### Credits
If you find this work useful in any way, be sure to star it and maybe shoot me a message at karanb@terpmail.umd.edu on any possible improvements. I sincerely thank Qi Wang for the VREP model of the Manta (on which the whole system is built).
